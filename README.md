## Environment

This project is developed and tested in:

  •	**Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04<br>
  •	**Python Version**: Python 3.10<br>
  •	**Dependencies**:<br>
    - `pygame` (2.6.1+)<br>
    - `pygame-menu` (4.4.8+)

---

## Installation

Clone and Navigate to Game Repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/internashionalist/atlas-Oregon_Trail_3000.git
$ cd atlas-Oregon_Trail_3000
```

## File Descriptions

  •	`main.py`: the main game file containing implementation of the gameplay loop, encounters, and resource management.<br>
  •	`assets/`: folder containing all visual and audio assets used in the game

## Usage

To run the game, use the following command:

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

## Gameplay

The game revolves around managing four key resources: Health, Ammo, Fuel, and Supplies. Players are presented with a series of encounters, each requiring strategic decision-making. Poor resource management or bad decisions can lead to game-ending situations.

### How to Play

1.	Launch the game using the *python3 main.py* command.
2.	Follow on-screen prompts to make choices during encounters.
3.	Monitor your resources displayed at the top of the screen.
4.	Survive through all encounters to win the game.

## Encounters

Players will face various threats to their survival throughout the game, including:<br>
•	**Lost Souls**: Fight or flee from a fiery swarm.<br>
•	**Lava River**: Cross molten terrain with creativity and resilience.<br>
•	**Marauders**: Defend your supplies from raiders or barter for safety.<br>
•	**Hellish Storm**: Navigate treacherous weather with resourcefulness.<br>
•	**Archdevil Boss Fight**: Test your limits against a powerful enemy.

## Resources

Players must monitor and use these precious resources strategically to complete the game:<br>
•	**Health**: Represents the party’s survival. If it drops to zero, the game ends.<br>
•	**Ammo**: Used in combat encounters to protect the party from danger.<br>
•	**Fuel**: Essential for advancing through encounters in your vehicle.<br>
•	**Supplies**: A general resource for various encounters and survival needs.

## Key Features

•	Dynamic encounter system with multiple choices and outcomes<br>
•	Resource management with visible progress bars<br>
•	High-quality visual assets for immersive gameplay<br>
•	Boss encounters with unique challenges<br>
•	Exciting Midi Audio

## Challenges

One of the greatest challenges was learning and mastering Pygame while simultaneously working
under strict deadlines. Designing smooth event loops and ensuring responsive player input
required careful planning and iteration. Integrating audio that complemented the retro-futuristic
atmosphere added further complexity, as both quality and consistency were difficult to achieve.
In addition, balancing the resource mechanics across encounters was an ongoing task, demanding
constant adjustment to keep the survival experience tense yet fair.


## Bugs

- Audio is low quality.
